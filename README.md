# LSTM2RL-SynthCryptoMarketMaker  

## Overview  
**`LSTM2RL-SynthCryptoMarketMaker`** is a personal project that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning to create a synthetic crypto market.  
- **LSTMs**: Model the order book and trade flow based on historical data.  
- **Surrogate Market**: A simulated market environment generated by the LSTMs.  
- **RL Market Maker**: A reinforcement learning agent trained in this synthetic environment to optimize quoting strategies, manage risks, and improve market efficiency.  

This project provides a framework for testing and improving market-making strategies in a controlled, data-driven environment.  

## Key Features  
- Train LSTMs on real crypto market data to replicate order book and trade behavior.  
- Use the synthetic market to train an RL agent for optimal market-making strategies.  
- Analyze the performance of the RL agent in managing risks and maximizing outcomes.  

## Objectives  
- Model complex market dynamics using deep learning.  
- Create a safe and flexible environment for experimenting with trading strategies.  
- Advance the understanding of liquidity provision and risk management in financial markets.
